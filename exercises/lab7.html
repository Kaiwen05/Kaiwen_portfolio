    <p> Today I’m coding with a cup of matcha next to me, lo-fi music in the background, and a cat that keeps walking on my keyboard. Honestly, the cat probably deserves partial credit for this lab.

    <p> Sometimes I just pause for a moment, stretch, and look outside my window. The trees move gently, the sky looks soft, and I remember that even a small break can reset everything.

    <p> Lately I’ve been enjoying quiet mornings. I make coffee, open my window, and let sunlight fall across my desk. It’s a simple moment that always makes the day feel like it’s starting in the right way.
